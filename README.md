# ❤️ ML Project: Predicting Heart Disease with High Recall

This machine learning project focuses on identifying patients with heart disease using clinical data. The primary goal is to **maximize recall**, ensuring that **no patient with heart disease is misclassified as healthy**. In medical diagnostics, minimizing false negatives is crucial to patient safety, making recall the most important metric in this context.

## 🎯 Objective

- **Goal:** Accurately predict the presence of heart disease using ML models.
- **Primary Metric:** **Recall** — to minimize false negatives.
- **Use Case:** No patient with a heart condition should be wrongly classified as safe.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ Methodology

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model selection (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- Evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- **Choosing the best model based on recall**
